âœ¨ Hey y'all! âœ¨ 

My name is Jenni and I have recently graduated from Business College Helsinki Full Stack Developer program.
My passion lies in the world of front-end development, where I find joy in crafting seamless user experiences and recently dabbling in JavaScript animations.  <br>
<br>
I'm actively seeking opportunities for a junior web developer position in the Helsinki region.<br>
<br>
When I'm not glued to the screens you can find me on the pitch playing football or spinning some records, some things are just better analog! &#127926;<br>
